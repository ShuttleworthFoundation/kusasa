# Kusasa

![Alt text](rw_common/images/Kusasa.png)

Kusasa provides a whole learning system which includes elearning software, curriculum-aligned content, teacher training, and a framework to establish a new culture of learning in schools. It comprises two key components: LAMS and eToys. LAMS is an Open Source elearning system. eToys is a programming language and environment designed for young learners. Both LAMS and eToys are tried and tested elearning tools, but their combination in Kusasa is something new.

Kusasa also provides a group of four characters who role-model analytical, critical and creative thinking habits. Learners get to know these characters through stories, and follow their guidance in elearning sequences and in eToys tutorials. 

Development now complete and the project is closed.
