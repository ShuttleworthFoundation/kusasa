        Once learners spend some time in schools they begin to
        think of learning as an activity involving listening,
        reading and memorising. Kusasa offers learners a whole new
        way of thinking about learning.
        <br />
        <br />
        With Kusasa learners will experience learning as the act of
        modelling: simulating the behaviour of an object, organism,
        process or system using easy-to-learn software.

        Modelling is not a new development. From <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes"
             rel="external"
             title="Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</a> to Einstein,
             scientists have been building mental models to
             understand all the wondrous phenomena of the cosmos.
             Throughout most of history the great mathematicians
             and scientists upon whose shoulders we now stand
             developed their models by prediction, observation,
             experimentation and reflection using all the available
             tools of their time. They would draw diagrams. They
             would build physical models. They would create objects
             to think with: anything to help them capture the
             fleeting ideas that would occur to them in flashes of
             inspiration. For the most part, their progress was
             slow but sure.
        <br />
        <br />
        With the march of technology from papyrus and paper to PCs
        and pixels, the tools of our time are computers and
        software. Computers make it possible for anyone to play
        with powerful mathematical and scientific concepts in the
        course of modelling even the simplest objects.
        <br />
        <br />
        To really appreciate the impact of modelling, you need only
        compare it with conventional teaching methods. Consider,
        for example, the challenge of helping learners to grasp the
        idea of algebraic variables: the dreaded "x" and "y" of
        introductory algebra. Many learners struggle to grasp the
        concept of a variable. But within a modelling environment
        learners intuitively grasp that each object they create has
        a position onscreen, which is shown by two numbers that
        vary as the object is moved around. Far from being
        dissociated from experience, as it is in conventional
        algebra, variability is something that can be directly
        experienced within the modelling environment.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Learning by making mistakes</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        More significant still is the emotional impact of modelling
        when compared with conventional teaching methods. When a
        learner makes mistakes on a maths worksheet or test, the
        errors can easily cause anxiety, humiliation, cognitive
        distrust and diminished self-esteem. But within a modelling
        environment mistakes are often a source of surprise and
        humour. When you try to make an object behave in a
        particular way and it does something you don't expect, you
        quickly want to discover where the fault is. This process
        of accidentally creating faults or "bugs" and fixing or
        "debugging" the objects is both entertaining and
        enlightening. Mistakes in the context of modelling are
        experienced as a source of learning (as they should be, but
        seldom are, in conventional education). Learners experience
        bugs as faults with the instructions not faults with
        themselves. And because learners actively engage in fixing
        the errors, their solutions to problems and the content
        they're learning are instinctively memorable.
        <br />
        <br />
        Paper and pen education simply cannot compare with the rich
        intellectual and emotional learning experience offered
        through modelling. However, when modelling is combined with
        <a href="../../projects/journal/journal.html"
             rel="self"
             title="Reflection">reflections</a>, the result is a
             radically and deeply empowering learning experience.
