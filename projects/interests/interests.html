        "Play is the highest form of research."
        <br />
        Albert Einstein
        <br />
        <br />
        "Do not keep children to their studies by compulsion but by
        play."
        <br />
        Plato
        <br />
        <br />
        "In play a child always behaves beyond his average age,
        above his daily behavior. In play it is as though he were a
        head taller than himself."
        <br />
        Lev Vygotsky
        <br />
        <br />
        "The very existence of youth is due in part to the
        necessity for play; the animal does not play because he is
        young, he has a period of youth because he must play."
        <br />
        Karl Groos
        <br />
        <br />
        "Almost all creativity involves purposeful play."
        <br />
        Abraham Maslow
        <br />
        <br />
        "Play is our brain's favorite way of learning."

        </div>Kusasa brings to education what every parent knows
        all too well: children learn best through play. Indeed as a
        learning methodology play works just as well for adults as
        it does for children. Does this mean that Kusasa is just
        frivolous fun? Certainly not. The learning that takes place
        through Kusasa's <a href=
        "../../projects/modelling/modelling.html"
             rel="self"
             title="Modelling">modelling</a> projects is hard fun
             in the same way that learning to walk is hard fun:
             it's tough but it's irresistible.
        <br />
        <br />
        Through Kusasa's <a href=
        "../../projects/modelling/modelling.html"
             rel="self"
             title="Modelling">modelling</a> projects learners will
             discover and use some of the most powerful ideas in
             mathematics and science, at first without even
             realising it. What makes this possible is learners'
             pursuit of their personal interests.
        <br />
        <br />
        Kusasa projects tap into the personal interests of learners
        at different ages: music, cars, motorcycles, dancing,
        computer games, board games, animals, skateboarding,
        surfing, fireworks, rugby, soccer, netball, hockey, and
        more. You name it; Kusasa has it covered.
        <br />
        <br />
        As learners embark on their Kusasa projects they will begin
        to think mathematically in the course of <a href=
        "../../projects/modelling/modelling.html"
             rel="self"
             title="Modelling">modelling</a> objects, organisms or
             processes that they themselves find interesting. For
             instance, suppose a learner wants to model the bounce
             of a soccer ball. First the learner will observe and
             measure the fall and bounces of a real soccer ball.
             Then he or she will have to use mathematics to set the
             acceleration of the ball as it falls, the height to
             which it bounces first, second, third, and so on.
             Kusasa brings such activities within the reach even of
             learners who might normally think of themselves as
             mathematically challenged.
        <br />
        <br />
        In creating virtual objects that simulate the action of
        real objects, learners will engage in real mathematical
        thinking at a depth that few conventional teaching methods
        can hope to equal.
