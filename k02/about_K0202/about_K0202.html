        <strong>Theme:</strong> Challenging your assumptions.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Synopsis</strong>
        <br />
        Tom and Jojo use a metal detector to seek treasure on the
        beach at dusk. Tom finds a small unidentified object and
        Jojo suggests continuing their search beyond a wall marked
        ‘No Entry’. Tom is reluctant but his curiosity is aroused
        by the response of his metal detector to the forbidden
        beach’s surface. The two trespassing treasure-seekers
        suddenly see what looks like an enormous sea monster and
        they flee.
        <br />
        <br />
        They return with the rest of the Thunderbolt Kids later
        that night to investigate the cause of their fright. It's
        not long before they find themselves caught between what
        appear to be a pterodactyl and a sea monster. Just as their
        plight seems truly desperate, the sea monster is revealed
        to be a submarine and a man emerges from it and deactivates
        the remote control ‘pterodactyl’.
        <br />
        <br />
        The man identifies himself as Henry Shellman. He explains
        his desire for privacy is the reason behind the no entry
        signs on the fence that borders the forbidden beach and he
        scolds the kids. Then he teaches them an important lesson:
        the need to look beneath the surface of things before
        forming judgements. He uses his subterranean home, the
        objects the kids found on the beach and his deceptive
        security system as examples.
        <br />
        <br />
        The story uses the metaphor of physically looking below the
        surface of things to represent thinking more deeply about
        the assumptions we make. Literally probing beneath the
        beach, the sea or the grime on an arrowhead would have
        given the Thunderbolt Kids more information and enabled
        them to correct the faulty assumptions that mislead them.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Activity</strong>
        <br />
        This activity challenges learners to count the number of
        triangles they can see in each of three figures made up of
        multiple triangles.
        <br />
        <br />
        The purpose of the activity is to allow learners to
        experience the feeling of scratching beneath the surface of
        something that appears obvious to find the truth
        underneath. Each of the figures appears at first glance to
        contain only a handful of triangles. But all it takes is
        for one learner to notice, just once, that some of the
        obvious triangles form "hidden" triangles when they join
        with adjacent triangles. This means that there are, in
        fact, many more triangles in each figure than what there
        initially appear to be.
        <br />
        <br />
        In doing this activity we want learners to practice
        questioning what they see and to recognise that sometimes
        the truth lies just a few questions beneath the surface.
        This is not at all because we wish to suggest that you
        cannot trust the evidence of your senses. Rather,
        questioning what appears to be obvious is an attitude that
        will serve your learners well in searching for truth.
        <br />

        </div><strong>The eToys project: Mosaic
        <br /></strong>In this project Farrah shows learners how to
        create simple scripts that work together to produce complex
        patterns. Ultimately the patterns they create depend on the
        “assumptions” built into their simple scripts. In this way
        learners discover for themselves that the simplest of
        details (the amount of turn or the number of repeats) can
        have a dramatic result in terms of the pattern created.
