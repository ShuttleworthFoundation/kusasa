        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Theme:</strong> Using information scientifically.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Synopsis</strong>
        <br />
        It’s love at first sight when Tom sees a hot air balloon.
        He decides to learn the intricacies of balloon construction
        and starts doing experiments with his own Helium-fuelled
        balloons. Tom explains his plan to the other Thunderbolt
        Kids: he will float several trial balloons and record the
        relevant results from each experiment. His first effort is
        a failure and Lazlo taunts him into making a rash bet: in
        three days, he will send his beloved robot up so high in
        the balloon that they’ll run out of measuring string.
        <br />
        <br />
        This story demonstrates sensible use of the scientific
        method in Tom’s attempts to achieve his purpose, i.e., to
        perfect his balloon. He gets some preparatory information
        from the balloonist he meets and uses this in setting up
        the basics of his experiment. But he must work out the
        details to improve on his design. He moves through each
        step of getting the balloon higher by employing the
        scientific method of “observation - hypothesis -
        experimentation.”
        <br />
        <br />
        So he observes his first trial balloon popping immediately
        and asks a question to form a hypothesises that he used too
        much gas. So he experiments by sending up another trial
        balloon with less gas and observes his results. Thus he
        completes the scientific method’s circle before spinning it
        again the next day. Through each stage in this cycle, Tom
        records all the data – or information – that relates to the
        conditions of the experiment. By analysing this information
        he is able to make intelligent hypotheses for improving the
        experiment.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Activity</strong>
        <br />
        This activity challenges learners to create a parachute
        toy. The purpose of the activity is to allow learners to
        practice the scientific cycle of building something,
        observing it's performance and then improving on the
        design. To some extent this activity mirrors Tom's
        experiments in the story. And even though it is much less
        complicated, learners can still exhibit the same degree of
        intensity and discipline as Tom in improving their designs.
        <br />
        <br />
        In doing this activity we want learners to recognise that
        their first attempt at making something does not have to be
        their last. We want them to realise that their first
        efforts are seldom their best and that there is always room
        for improvement. Tom's focus is a good model to follow for
        this attitude towards achieving excellence.

        <br /></strong>In this project Tom shows learners how to
        take the information (data) produced by a slider control
        and transfer or feed it into a hot air balloon object. Thus
        learners discover for themselves that the changing numbers
        of one object can be used to control another objects by
        changing its numbers proportionally.
