        <strong>Synopsis</strong>
        <br />
        The Virtual Reality machine sends The Thunderbolt Kids back
        to Imperial Rome to compete in a series of mental
        challenges against their peers. Their initial delight turns
        to horror when, back in the real world, Lazlo slyly turns
        the difficulty setting of their game way up. This turns
        their virtual reality distinctly nasty as the Emperor
        threatens to feed Farrah to a tiger if her friends fail to
        complete his challenge. Meanwhile Lazlo’s group begin their
        game on a much easier setting.
        <br />
        <br />
        When things turn really tough for The Thunderbolt Kids,
        help arrives in the form of a floating effegy of the
        mathematician, George Polya. Poyla asks questions which
        help the kids change the way the look at each of their
        challenges. That is, he helps them to change their point of
        view.
        <br />
        <br />
        Poyla’s questions first prompt the Thunderbolt Kids to
        think like Romans to walk the ‘thousand steps’ through the
        first challenge. Similarly, it is only after they shelve
        their assumption that they have to face the second
        challenge head-on by dodging its blades that the kids can
        beat it. They follow the How to Solve It method of breaking
        problems up into easy steps to realise that breaking the
        machine is a lot simpler than dodging its blades. Each
        question-oriented strategy that they follow from the How to
        Solve It method is tantamount to a change in point of view.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Activity</strong>
        <br />
        This activity challenges learners to create a scytale
        cypher. The purpose of the activity is to allow the
        learners to work physically with a concrete example of how
        changing the way you look at something can change what you
        see. That is, looking at your scytale cypher on the wrong
        cylinder will show you nothing but gibberish. Viewing the
        same cypher on the appropriate cylinder will reveal it's
        hidden message. This is very similar to the benefits you
        gain from changing your point of view when examining
        anything from a math problem to a political argument. Being
        able to switch your point of view will help you to see
        things you didn't see before and this can lead you to
        finding solutions that you didn't think were possible.
        <br />
        <br />
        In doing this activity we want learners recognise that
        there isn't only one way to look at a challenge. There are
        many. And some are more helpful than others from time to
        time.

        </div><strong>The eToys project: Gladiator
        <br /></strong>In this project Sophie shows learners how to
        create a simple game in eToys. To create this game
        effectively learners must put themselves in the shoes of
        the gladiator character onscreen and see the game from his
        point of view. Once again, this is not a rocket science
        project. It is simply giving learners an opportunity to
        practise adopting a different point of view within the
        framework of an eToys project. Once again, learners are
