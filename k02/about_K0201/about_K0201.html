        <strong>Theme:</strong> Thinking with questions.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Synopsis</strong>
        <br />
        Sophie researches the mechanics of posing questions while
        the Thunderbolt Kids laze by the river. They are
        interrupted by a shower of fish from the sky and a crazed
        Lazlo who ascribes the strange turn in the weather to the
        imminent arrival of aliens. Sophie uses her new
        understanding of questions to try figure out what’s going
        on. Jojo recognises the fish and thus where they came from,
        as well as whom to ask for help. He phones Dr Roberts who
        tells the kids that the day’s strange events are caused by
        a waterspout.
        <br />
        <br />
        Dr Roberts warns the Thunderbolt Kids to get everyone
        inside and away from the river. Lazlo’s deluded desire to
        find aliens forces Jojo to brave the now-dangerous rain of
        coconuts. Lazlo resist’s Jojo’s attempts at rescue until a
        coconut knocks him out. Jojo carries him through the deadly
        rain to safety.
        <br />
        <br />
        This story is riddled with questions, from the first to the
        last panel. Sophie’s six questions halfway through the tale
        are rational tools to find the answer to the larger
        question: why are fish falling from the sky? Sophie starts
        at the beginning of the investigative process by asking
        simple questions that have answers that can be linked to
        other questions with more answers to yet more questions and
        so on.
        <br />
        <br />
        Her approach contrasts strongly with Lazlo’s “Do you know
        what this means?” He jumps straight to the end of the
        thinking process and immediately decides that the answer to
        his question is “The Aliens are coming.” He has clearly
        jumped to the conclusion that appeals to him, not one that
        relies on the logical application of evidence to answer
        relevant questions.
        <br />
        Lazlo’s wrong-headed thinking stems from his failure to ask
        relevant questions and find examples from the real world
        that parallel his logic (or lack thereof).
        <br />

        <strong>Activity</strong>
        <br />
        This activity challenges learners to play the game, 20
        Questions. The purpose of the activity is to allow learners
        to practice asking pointed questions for a specific purpose
        in a non-threatening environment.
        <br />
        <br />
        Learners often struggle to think of questions to
        interrogate a topic because they battle to focus their busy
        minds on something specific. But the goal of 20 Questions
        is clear: work out who I am thinking about and do it by
        asking 20 questions or less. Another reason kids struggle
        to ask questions in class is that they're afraid that
        others may think less of them if they ask a question that
        is perceived as stupid. But because it is a game, 20
        Questions cultivates a non-threatening atmosphere where
        learners find asking questions exciting.
        <br />
        <br />
        In doing this activity we want learners to recognise that
        some questions are more helpful than others during the
        game. Asking broad questions early on such as, "Are you
        alive or dead?" and "Are you male or female?" are more
        helpful than asking, "Are you Nelson Mandela?" It doesn't
        take long at all for learners to realise this, which helps
        them to develop their question asking skills.
        <br />

        </div><strong>The eToys project: Aquarium
        <br /></strong>In this project Sophie shows learners how to
        build an aquarium in eToys. Sophie asks and answers
        questions throughout the process of construction. In this
        way she models the centrality of question-asking in
        analytical thinking. Learners write simple scripts for a
        range of sea creatures, creating an onscreen model of an
        aquarium. There is nothing particularly difficult or
        profound about this project. It is good example of placing
        learners in <a href=

             rel="self"
