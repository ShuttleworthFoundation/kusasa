        <strong>Theme:</strong> Scientific ideas.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Synopsis</strong>
        <br />
        Tia asks a friend at the Science Museum to organise a
        special after-hours tour for her students. When they enter
        the museum, the kids are ushered away by a man claiming to
        be an assistant to the curator. Meanwhile Tia is whisked
        away to meet her friend. But she soon finds out that her
        friend has been taken hostage and that the man taking the
        kids for a tour is merely trying to distract them.
        <br />
        <br />
        The kidnappers want Tia and her friend to follow a recipe
        to make the Philosopher's Stone, using ingredients found in
        the museum. Meanwhile, Klaus leads the kids around the
        museum and imparts his distinctly unscientific knowledge
        about scientific ideas. The kids are sceptical. They
        recognise the unscientific character of the things he is
        saying. And they recognise the facts that dispute his
        assertions about scientific principles and phenomena. When
        they have had enough of his mystical ranting they engineer
        a clever escape, using their knowledge of science against
        him. Meanwhile, Tia and her friend do likewise by causing
        their recipe to literally blow up in the faces of their
        kidnappers.
        <br />
        <br />
        This story offers a comparison of two fundamentally
        different lenses through which to view the world: science
        and mysticism. The Thunderbolt Kids represent and utilise
        scientific models of reasoning in their approach to Klaus’
        lesson and the threat that Klaus's mystical worldview
        represents. Klaus's character is, of course, a caricature.
        His mysticism is over the top but lots of people share the
        broad strokes of his haphazard approach to the empirical
        sciences. Klaus may have made an excellent tour guide in a
        museum dedicated to displaying the great fallacies of
        mysticism, but he’s dreadfully out of context here.
        <br />
        <br />
        This story explores the nature of ideas, with the focus on
        ideas that are scientific. By pitting their wits against
        Klaus and the kidnappers, The Thunderbolt Kids and Tia
        introduce learners to the notion that some ideas are
        scientific in nature – backed up by empirical evidence –
        and some are not.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Activity</strong>
        <br />
        This activity challenges learners to identify the abstract
        ideas that connect other ideas that are more concrete. On
        the activity sheet are four lists of nouns. At the top of
        each list is a cloud. We ask learners to choose one idea
        from a box of ideas that logically connects the nouns in
        the list and to write it in the cloud.
        <br />
        <br />
        The purpose of the activity is to show learners the
        interconnectivity of different ideas. In this case there is
        more than one answer for each of the lists of nouns. But
        through discussion learners will have to decide which idea
        they believe most logically connects all the nouns in the
        list.
        <br />
        <br />
        In doing this activity we want learners to recognise that a
        single idea can denote a number of different sub-ideas. In
        this way the exercise lays the foundation for more
        complicated conceptual thinking exercises.

        </div><strong>The eToys project: Magnet
        <br /></strong>In this project learners use an onscreen
        joystick to control a magnet object, which they use to pick
        up a car. The purpose of the project is to provide an
        opportunity for trial-and-error experimentation within
        eToys. Learners are creating a simulated system and putting
        it to the test.
