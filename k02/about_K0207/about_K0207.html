        <strong>Theme:</strong> Thinking through implications.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Synopsis</strong>
        <br />
        The kids are playing with paper aeroplanes and are
        surprised to see their creations soar into the heavens.
        They see the island’s ‘dormant’ volcano smoking ominously
        and investigate. Steaming groundwater and a sulphurous
        stench prompts them to return to the school, where they
        find Lazlo foretelling the impending attack of the ’Munchy
        Monster’. Farrah recognises this beast from a sketch of her
        Halloween costume and the kids decide to debunk Lazlo’s
        hysterical prophecy.
        <br />
        <br />
        Some research enables the kids to use their observations to
        form a rough hypothesis that the island’s volcano is no
        longer dormant. They resolve to test their prediction
        scientifically to avoid repeating Lazlo’s error.
        <br />
        <br />
        This story is about the role of thinking through
        implications to make accurate predictions. It demonstrates
        the ease of making predictions without carefully weighting
        up the implications of facts by detailing Lazlo’s crazed
        mutterings – but clearly demonstrates the folly of doing
        so. Tom points out early on that the sign of the smoking
        volcano means nothing until the kids can investigate its
        implications before making any predictions.
        <br />
        <br />
        The kids form the hypothesis that the volcano is going to
        erupt. Then, in true scientific fashion, they try to prove
        themselves wrong. That is, rather than looking for evidence
        to support their prediction, they search for signs that
        their prediction is false.
        <br />
        <br />
        Compare this method to Lazlo’s faith in his horoscope, a
        completely unscientific form of predicting the future. His
        horoscope could be telling him almost anything and his
        interpretation of it is subjective and tailored to his
        desire to prove himself right. He believes that ‘knowledge
        is a terrible burden’ but the story demonstrates that all
        he is burdened by is self-imposed fear and superstition.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Activity</strong>
        <br />
        This activity challenges learners to build paper aeroplanes
        and to predict how their designs will perform. Once they
        have observed how their plans fly, they are challenged to
        hypothesise what changes may improve performance. They then
        predict the difference their changes will make and repeat
        the process.
        <br />
        <br />
        The purpose of the activity is to allow learners the
        opportunity to practice using the scientific method in a
        fun way. It also brings reduces the seemingly complex
        challenge of prediction down to simple, fun level.
        <br />
        <br />
        In doing this activity we want learners to build a habit of
        questioning how objects behave and how they can influence
        their behaviour. We want them to ask, "How can I make it
        better?" and, "What difference will this change make? and,
        "What changes will produce the result that I want?"
        <br />
        <br />

        </div><strong>The eToys project
        <br /></strong>In this project Jojo shows learners how to
        create a volcanic eruption in eToys. Learners explore the
        anatomy of a volcano and how an eruption entails the action
        of magma, lava, rock and smoke. In scripting the behaviour
        of each of the constituent parts of the volcano, learners
        come to understand volcanic activity in a much richer way
        than merely by reading. More importantly, the lesson
        learned is that <strong><em>anything</em></strong> modelled
        in a similar way in eToys offers a richer learning
        experience than can be provided by less interactive
        learning methodologies.
