        offers role models for thinking</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        When we think about our
        <strong><em>educational</em></strong> experience we tend to
        think about school or university. And when we think of
        these we often think of listening to a talker at the front
        of a room. But when we think about our best
        <strong><em>learning</em></strong> experiences we probably
        think about our role models who taught us by example rather
        than by instruction. Kusasa provides problem-solving role
        models who show by example what it means to be a creative,
        committe, analytical thinker. Our characters talk about and
        show in action how they solve problems.
        <br />
        <br />
        These four role models appear in the Kusasa content for
        grade 4. (The characters grow up through each grade of
        Kusasa, thus matching the ages of the learners in each
        grade.) As you will see, they represent four different
        learning and thinking styles, which means learners are
        likely to empathise strongly with at least one of these
        characters. In doing so, learners can discover how they can
        more effectively use their own, natural thinking style
        (which may not be fully appreciated or encouraged within
        their own school). And they can discover how to supplement
        their intuitive thinking style with other ways of thinking.

        Sophie is a verbal / linguistic thinker. She has the
        personality of a theorist. She's always asking questions,
        always reading a new book, and her favourite place is the
        school library. She has strong opinions on every subject
        under the sun, and it takes a lot to convince her of your
        opinion with her highly sceptical nature.

        Tom is a logical / mathematical thinker. He has the
        personality of an inventor. He's always tinkering with his
        latest invention, and looking out for new inventive
        challenges. His favourite place is the science lab, where
        he can conduct his latest experiments, and the junk yard,
        where he can find bits and pieces of rubbish to turn into
        his next invention.

        Farrah is a visual and musical thinker. She has the
        personality of an artist. She's always drawing, painting or
        doing some kind of dance or dramatic performance. She's
        very trusting of people and their opinions. Sometimes too
        trusting and a little gullible. She loves talking to people
        and learning about them, which helps her as a performer.
        She can do uncanny impressions of just about anyone,
        including Sophie. But the two girls are inseparable. Farrah
        learns from Sophie how to be more analytical; Sophie
        learners from Farrah how to be more imaginative and
        creative in her thinking. Learners absorb both ways of
        thinking from these two characters.

        Jojo is a kinesthetic or bodily thinker. He has the
        personality of a doer. He's always the first to leap into
        action to get things done. He has boundless energy and is
        playful at all times. Sometimes the others find him
        exhausting. He is a little messy, which can irritate Tom.
        But the two are, nonetheless, good mates. Jojo learns from
        Tom how to be more systematic and methodical in his
        approach to solving problems; Tom learners from Jojo how to
        be more action and goal-oriented, and how to get to grips
        with problems by immersing not only his mind but also his
        muscles in his daily challenges. Learners absorb both ways
        of thinking from these two characters.
