        <!-- Sidebar header -->
        The world has changed dramatically over the last 100 years,
        but school has remained much the same.
        <br />
        <br />
        Kusasa aims to show learners how to use computers, not for
        "drill-and-kill" instruction, but expressively and
        creatively. We want learners to use computers to explore
        their own interests and the objects of their studies in
        different learning areas in ways that make deep
        mathematical thinking natural, intuitive and engaging.

        </div>The Shuttleworth Foundation recognises the many
        challenges facing dedicated educators and aspiring learners
        in South Africa and in many other countries. At the same
        time, we recognise the spectacular <a href=
        "../../background/changes/changes.html"
             rel="self"
             title="Changes">changes</a> that technology has
             brought about outside the classroom. Kusasa recognises
             the opportunity to bring new educational technologies
             into the classroom, to bridge the technological gap
             between society and school.
        <br />
        <br />
        In South Africa and in many other countries, mathematics
        and science education face a crisis. In South Africa, the
        origin of the problem is the chronic shortage of
        mathematics teachers. But the problem extends beyond supply
        and demand.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        Just a few years ago, the only cultural distraction for
        learners was TV. But learners of today are drawn to TV, CD,
        DVD, SMS, MP3, PC, PSP, Wii, and more. So it is not
        surprising that even the best maths and science teachers
        struggle against these alphabet amusements. How can you
        attract and retain attention among learners whose minds
        would rather be elsewhere?
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Yet, if we are honest, we must recognise that the problem
        of drawing learners into mathematics (and science) is not a
        recent phenomenon. To the extent that mathematics and
        science are formalised, dissociated and presented out of
        their natural context, as so often happens at school,
        learners find them tedious, boring and mentally painful.
        And, to the extent that we fail to develop mathematicians
        and scientists, we fail to develop some of the most
        valuable intellectual Atlases of tomorrow, who can carry
        the hopes of the nation on their shoulders.
        <br />
        <br />
        For these reasons we need to find new ways to build
        analytical capacity in learners. These new techniques need
        to speak to the real interests of today's learners. Some
        artificial motivation quickly thrown in at the beginning of
        a lesson just won't do. What is needed are tools that
        enable learners to explore their personal interests, yet
        carry with them powerful mathematical and scientific ways
        of thinking, which become second nature for learners.
        <br />
        <br />
        Kusasa offers just such computational and creative learning
        tools. Yet it also recognises the real constraints on
        teacher training and availability. Kusasa is not just free
        software, but a whole learning system which includes
        software, curriculum-aligned content, teacher training, and
        a framework to establish a new culture of learning.

        </div>With the phenomenal <a href=
        "../../background/changes/changes.html"
             rel="self"
             title="Changes">changes</a> that have taken place
             outside the classroom over the last 100 years, Kusasa
             recognises that it is time to bring some of those
             changes into the classroom in order to prepare
             learners for the challenges of the 21st century. The
             cost of computers continues to plummet even as their
             power expands. Recognising the educational
             opportunities that computers make possible, many
             countries are embarking on substantial programmes to
             ensure that learners have access to this technology.
             For instance, the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project
             is aiming to distribute "hundred dollar laptops" to
             millions of children in developing countries around
             the world. Kusasa aims to use ordinary, cheap computer
             laboratories to make up for the lack of mathematical
             teaching capacity.
        <br />
        <br />
        Kusasa provides a curriculum for using dynamic modelling
        environments to explore concepts in different learning
        areas. It does not depend on mathematical knowledge or
        skills. And it does not depend on the availability of
        highly skilled teachers. It will help schools to develop a
        culture of teacher facilitation and peer mentoring. Kusasa
        offers a new learning culture focused on the development of
        analytical and creative thinking which can overcome the
        resistance of many learners to mathematics and science.
        <br />
        <br />
        The falling cost and rising power of computers represents
        an opportunity. Today we can use computers and freely
        available software designed for learners to compensate for
        the shortage of maths and science teachers. But computers
        can also overcome the problem of trying to get learners to
        "love the maths they hate" by providing them with a new
        kind of <a href="../../background/mathland/mathland.html"
             rel="self"
             title="Mathland">maths they love</a>.
