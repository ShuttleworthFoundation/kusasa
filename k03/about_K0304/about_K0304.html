        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Theme:</strong> Listening to other people's points
        of view.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Synopsis</strong>
        <br />
        After watching a powerboat race, Tom introduces himself to
        the head engineer of the winning team. He finds out all he
        can about powerboating and becomes fascinated with the
        sport. Seeing his enthusiasm, the engineer offers to let
        Tom work on an old junior powerboat in preparation for a
        youth race the following weekend. Tom is elated and works
        tirelessly throughout the week to prepare the boat for
        racing. But when the race day comes, conditions are
        completely diffferent from those in which he has tested the
        boat. Jojo is the driver and tries to dissuade Tom from
        entering, as he is afraid of losing control of the boat,
        but Tom refuses to listen to his protests.
        <br />
        <br />
        This story focuses on the balance between trusting your own
        judgment and knowing when the time is right to listen to
        other people's points of view. The powerboat engineer is a
        role model for Tom. His advice to Tom is to always listen
        to the facts and to trust his own judgment. Throughout the
        week Tom heeds his advice. Day after day Tom makes steady
        improvements to his boat by recording and analysing data
        from tests. But in the end he is so sure of his own
        judgment that he fails to take notice of the obvious
        difference between the conditions in which he tested his
        boat and the conditions in which Jojo will have to race it.

        Good thinkers are confident in their ability to think
        things through. But they also know when it is valuable to
        seek other people's opinions. And they do not see this as a
        weakness in their own abilities. Rather, they see it as a
        strength that they know when to seek advice.

        <strong>Activity</strong>
        <br />
        This activity challenges learners to sketch their own
        deisgn for a new kind of bicycle.
        <br />
        <br />
        The purpose of the activity is to get learners to think of
        the purpose of a familiar object according to the point of
        view of the user. The activity sets up the idea that there
        are many different types of bicycle because different
        people have different uses for it. That is, different
        people with different purposes have different points of
        view on how a bicycle should be designed. With this in
        mind, we ask learners to think of a new point of view for
        how a bicycle should be used. With this purpose in mind,
        they make a sketch of their design.
        <br />
        <br />
        In doing this activity we want learners to recognise the
        link between purpose, point of view and design. And that
        thinking about something from a new point of view can help
        you to be creative.

        </div><strong>The eToys project:</strong>
        Powerboat<strong><br /></strong>In this project Tom shows
        learners how to create a powerboat and how to use a
        steering wheel to navigate the boat around an island. More
        importantly, Tom shows learners how to create a
        representation of the powerboat, mapping the movement of
        the powerboat around the island to the movement of a dot
        around a small map of the island. The intention of this
        project is give learners the experience of creating a
        representation, which is a kind of point of view.
