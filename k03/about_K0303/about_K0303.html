        <strong>Theme:</strong> Checking your assumptions.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Synopsis</strong>
        <br />
        The Thunderbolt Kids attend Dr Gray’s ‘Science of Magic’
        expo. They like the exhibits but not the salad-based food
        they are given for lunch. Dr Gray shows them a few optical
        illusions and explains how they work. He explains that such
        illusions use our assumptions to trick the eye and that
        they can be beaten by careful scrutiny, measurement and the
        desire to look below the surface of things.
        <br />
        <br />
        When the kids start getting sick, Tia suspects that there
        may have been something wrong with the food they ate for
        lunch. But the arrogant Dr Gray refuses to believe there
        could have been anything wrong with his food. Even though
        he is ready to preach to the kids about avoiding faulty
        assumptions, he is too arrogant to see the facts and he
        falsely attributes the kids nausea to a variety of random
        causes. Until he gets sick himself, that is.
        <br />
        <br />
        The story uses optical illusions to demonstrate the folly
        of believing everything we see, no matter how strange,
        without questioning. It also uses the plot’s culinary
        events to further demonstrate the foolishness of clinging
        to assumptions despite the testimony of our senses. Dr Gray
        refuses to even countenance the possibility of his food
        being tainted because he consider himself immune to making
        false assumptions. This makes him dismiss Tia’s argument
        with increasingly silly points until his own nausea
        silences him. The tale shows your learners how science can
        debunk ‘magic’ and that rationality can trump any attempt
        to deceive us.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Activity</strong>
        <br />
        This activity challenges learners to analyse a series of
        optical illusions related to two-dimensional measurements.
        In each case we ask them to measure parts of the illusion.
        <br />
        <br />
        The purpose of the activity is to encourage learners not to
        be passive when analysing a problem. Rather than examining
        something only with their eyes they should not hesitate to
        pick up a ruler, a compass or any other tool that helps
        them measure and record data that they can then analyse
        objectively, both in and out of context.
        <br />
        <br />
        In doing this activity we want learners to learn the habit
        of questioning their assumptions on a scientific level.
        Rather than believing every unusual thing that they see or
        hear, they should realise that scientific investigation is
        open to them at any time. And that it is far more
        accessible to them than it might seem. It takes little
        effort to use a ruler or a scale or any measuring tool to
        take measurements. And yet this kind of active engagement
        with the world has an enormously positive effect on their
        cognitive faculties.

        </div><strong>The eToys project:</strong> Optical
        illusion<strong><br /></strong>In this project Farrah shows
        learners how to construct several optical illusions in
        eToys. In creating these illusions rather than simply
        seeing them in LAMS or on a worksheet, learners can gain a
        much richer understanding of how optical illusions work.
        The intention underpinning this project is to reinforce the
        idea that our intuitive mental representations do not
        always match the world outside of our minds, and that to be
        effective thinkers we need to test our mental
        representations.
