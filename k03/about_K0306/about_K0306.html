        "Concepts represent condensations of knowledge, which make
        further study and the division of cognitive labor
        possible."
        <br />
        Ayn Rand
        <br />
        <br />
        "None of [the traditional theories of concepts] regards
        concepts as objective, i.e., as neither revealed nor
        invented, but as produced by man’s consciousness in
        accordance with the facts of reality, as mental
        integrations of factual data computed by man—as the
        products of a cognitive method of classification whose
        processes must be performed by man, but whose content is
        dictated by reality."
        <br />
        Ayn Rand
        <br />
        <br />
        "Every individual is at once the beneficiary and the victim
        of the linguistic tradition into which he has been born -
        the beneficiary inasmuch as language gives access to the
        accumulated records of other people's experience, the
        victim in so far as it confirms him in the belief that
        reduced awareness is the only awareness and as it bedevils
        his sense of reality, so that he is all too apt to take his
        concepts for data, his words for actual things."

        <strong>Theme:</strong> Thinking conceptually.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Synopsis</strong>
        <br />
        Tia prepares frantically for the arrival of one of the
        school's benefactors, the fussy Mr Schnoz. She is most
        worried about impressing Mr Schnoz at the lunch table
        because she knows how particular he is about food. The chef
        knows too. And he is so frightened of the challenge that he
        runs away. When the Thunderbolt Kids realise this, they
        don't have the heart to stress out Tia any further. Instead
        they decide to prepare lunch themselves.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sophie, Farrah and Tom head for the library to try find out
        more about cooking. But Jojo stays in the kitchen, as he is
        convinced that there is a simpler, better way to confront
        this problem than researching French cooking methods in the
        library.
        <br />
        <br />
        This story is about taking a seemingly complicated problem
        and simplifying it by thinking conceptually. The questions
        Jojo asks while cooking are questions that help him to
        think conceptually about the dishes he has to cook and the
        ingredients he must use to cook them. Using his own sense
        of taste to fill in the gaps in his knowledge allows him to
        prepare lunch on time and, apparently, very well.
        <br />
        <br />
        Jojo's questions are equally useful in identifying and
        isolating concepts from a variety of other contexts as they
        are in the kitchen. You can use all of these questions to
        help your learners identify, isolate or explore concepts:
        <br />
        <br />
        • How can I separate this problem (or challenge or idea)
        into parts?
        <br />
        • What is the most fundamental part?
        <br />
        • Which of these parts have something in common?
        <br />
        • Which of these parts are different?
        <br />
        • Which of these parts belong together?
        <br />
        • Which of these parts should be separate?
        <br />
        • What is left over?
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Activity</strong>
        <br />
        This activity challenges learners to create a categories
        map. Given the skeleton of a categories map, the learners
        must read through the ideas that will form part of the map
        and then ask a series of questions that help them to sort
        the ideas into their appropriate places on the map.
        <br />
        <br />
        The purpose of the activity is to get learners to practice
        asking idea organising questions and to practice
        categorising and recording their thoughts.
        <br />
        <br />
        In doing this activity we want learners to recognise how
        ideas are interlinked. Using a simple, standard set of
        questions can help you to reveal these links.

        Game<strong><br /></strong>In this project Jojo shows
        learners how to create a simple sorting game for toddlers.
        Learners must program three baskets to accept objects from
        the appropriate category, and reject objects from other
        categories. It’s a simple game but one that requires
        careful, analytical thinking.
