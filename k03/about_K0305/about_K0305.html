        <strong>Synopsis</strong>
        <br />
        Jojo uses his savings to buy plain white t-shirts in bulk.
        He has a plan to sell them all for a profit so he can buy
        his dream mountain bike. But when his first day of sales
        goes badly, Jojo refuses to listen to his friends'
        suggestions for a change in plan. Jojo's is so focused on
        the big picture of making enough money to buy his bike that
        he fails to pay enough attention to the daily details that
        will earn him his reward. His friends know that he has done
        no research into what kinds of t-shirts kids would like to
        buy. Sophie, Tom and Farrah spend time gathering this
        information and working on designs and packaging based on
        what they learn. When Jojo sees the results he realises he
        was wrong to reject their suggestions and their offers to
        help.
        <br />
        <br />
        This story is about identifying the kinds of information
        that will be useful to you in coping with your challenge
        and then going out and getting that information. Although
        Jojo shows great entrepreneurial promise, he assumes that
        the challenge of making money is complete the moment he
        buys t-shirts cheaply. He fails to recognise that although
        he has the seed of a good business venture, he needs to do
        a lot more work before it starts to pay off. And to do that
        work he needs some very specific information.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Activity</strong>
        <br />
        This activity challenges learners to question their
        partners to find out what kind of t-shirt they would like
        to wear. Using this information they must then design a
        t-shirt that they believe their partners would like to
        wear.
        <br />
        <br />
        The purpose of the activity is to give learners the chance
        to gather and interpret information.
        <br />
        <br />
        In doing this activity we want learners to recognise that
        there is a link between the information they absorb and the
        actions that they perform based on what they have learned.
        <br />
        <br />

        </div><strong>The eToys project:</strong> Designing in
        eToys<strong><br /></strong>In this project learners use
        eToys to create T-shirt designs. Jojo shows learners how to
        write simple scripts for three simple objects to create
        patterns that emerge out of their combined behaviour. This
        project offers learners the opportunity to use eToys to
        create aesthetic designs, which in turn could be used for a
        practical purpose such as the design on a T-shirt.
