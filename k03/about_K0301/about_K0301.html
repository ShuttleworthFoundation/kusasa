        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Theme:</strong> Thinking with a purpose.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Synopsis
        <br /></strong>Tia sets her class a prize-earning challenge
        to build something out of drinking straws. Farrah has
        ambitious plans to make something complicated and beautiful
        and Tom prioritises durability. They decide to work
        together. Jojo envisions a series of replicas of sporting
        equipment that he could sell. Sophie is drawn to his scheme
        because she believes it will entail lots of research
        pertaining to the performance of the equipment his models
        resemble. They also decide to work together.
        <br />
        <br />
        Farrah and Tom start working immediately. Their purpose is
        clear and it directs their actions. They want to make a
        beautiful, durable structure. Jojo's purpose is also
        clearly defined. He wants to make sport equipment replicas
        to sell for cash. Sophie wants to do research, which would
        be fine if she intended to feed her research into the
        exercise of building a structure out of straws. But when
        she researches through the night and spends no time helping
        Jojo build, the two end up in a fight.
        <br />
        <br />
        The story demonstrates the importance of thinking with a
        purpose by showing what happens when you deviate from your
        purpose – even just a little. Sophie's love of research is
        often useful in achieving her goals but this time she and
        Jojo just needed to knuckle down and get building. She lost
        sight of her purpose and did what she liked to do instead
        of working towards her goal and doing what she had to do to
        build her structure in time for the deadline the following
        day.
        <br />
        <br />
        Note that some preparation was useful to Tom and Farrah.
        However, they spent only a short time thinking through some
        structural principles and they made a sketch to make their
        statue. They realised that this was a practical assignment,
        where the point of the exercise was to spend time building.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Activity</strong>
        <br />
        This activity challenges learners to build base shapes – a
        triangle, a square, a hexagon and a pentagon – and then to
        use these base shapes to build pyramids and prisms.
        <br />
        <br />
        The purpose of the activity is to lay a physical foundation
        in the learners minds for the nature of three-dimensional
        shapes. We want them to internalise and get a feeling for
        how these shapes occupy space. We also want learners to
        recognise the modular nature of three-dimensional shapes.

        learners how to script an object to build a wall in eToys.
        The project has a clear purpose: to build a wall. Tom takes
        learners through a process of analysis to construct scripts
        that will control a “Jojo bot” to build the wall.
