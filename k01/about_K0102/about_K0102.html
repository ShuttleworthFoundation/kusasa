        <strong>Theme:</strong> Using information to improve your
        work.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Synopsis</strong>
        <br />
        The Thunderbolt kids design push-cars and compete to propel
        them the farthest with a single push. Everyone works hard
        through multiple versions of their models except for Lazlo
        and his sidekick. They spy on their classmates and copy
        their designs instead of making their own mistakes. Their
        push-car is a combination other characters’ designs and
        falls apart on the ramp.
        <br />
        <br />
        Lazlo fails because he steals the end product of other
        people’s work without going through the process of learning
        himself. Sophie finds that her push-car won't go straight
        without a gutter and needs to be heavier in front. Farrah
        finds that her sail needs to be closed when the push-car
        sets off. Tom uses scientific principles to test and retest
        the effects of changes he makes to his booster. And Jojo's
        design depends on solid aerodynamics to ensure the hood
        doesn't detach from the skateboard.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Thunderbolt Kids develop their models through various
        stages of trial and error and scientific hypotheses. At
        each stage of development they gather and analyse
        information that helps them to make their next draft more
        effective. This means that they learn something from the
        competition, which is the real victory. And so this story
        encourages learners to see their work in Kusasa – all their
        work, in fact – as ever-evolving and always open to
        improvement. And they explore the idea that analysing
        information is key to producing better work.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Activity:</strong> The Car Experiment
        <br />
        The Car Experiment loosely parallels what the Thunderbolt
        Kids do in the story. Your learners do an experiment to
        test their predictions about the effect of gradient on a
        toy car’s speed. This gives them the opportunity to record
        and analyse information. It also allows them to fine tune
        the conditions of the experiment to give them more accurate
        results. They might build longer ramps, find more accurate
        stopwatches or use bigger toy cars. The important thing
        about this exercise is that it teaches your learners the
        value of learning from their mistakes and using the
        information that they have to help them improve.

        </div><strong>The eToys project: Hot Rod!</strong>
        <br />
        Learners follow Tom’s instructions to make a car slow down
        onscreen just like the cars in the classroom activity.
        Unlike most of the eToys projects available online, which
        require that objects first be painted using the paint
        palette, Kusasa projects provide illustrated or
        photographic objects. Once learners have completed each
        project they are able to use these objects in their own
        projects, and thereby to build up a “toybox” of objects to
        play with.
        <br />
        <br />
        Some of the eToys projects include a fun “splash page”
        which learners can come back to and examine when they
        become more familiar with eToys. For instance, in this
        project the splash page includes a tiny car which
        automatically races around the grey track.
