        "Concepts represent condensations of knowledge, which make
        further study and the division of cognitive labor
        possible."
        <br />
        Ayn Rand
        <br />
        <br />
        "None of [the traditional theories of concepts] regards
        concepts as objective, i.e., as neither revealed nor
        invented, but as produced by man’s consciousness in
        accordance with the facts of reality, as mental
        integrations of factual data computed by man—as the
        products of a cognitive method of classification whose
        processes must be performed by man, but whose content is
        dictated by reality."
        <br />
        Ayn Rand
        <br />
        <br />
        "Every individual is at once the beneficiary and the victim
        of the linguistic tradition into which he has been born -
        the beneficiary inasmuch as language gives access to the
        accumulated records of other people's experience, the
        victim in so far as it confirms him in the belief that
        reduced awareness is the only awareness and as it bedevils
        his sense of reality, so that he is all too apt to take his
        concepts for data, his words for actual things."

        <strong>Theme:</strong> The importance of concepts.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Synopsis</strong>
        <br />
        The Thunderbolt kids find a map left behind by the school’s
        first students. This leads them to a cave the holds a
        golden apple. When they enter the cave Jojo grabs the apple
        immediately and the kids become trapped. By solving a
        series of riddles and completing challenges the kids
        eventually find their way out the cave. Each riddle and
        each challenge teaches them something about the building
        blocks of ideas. And, overall, the message is that thinking
        about things is not automatic and easy. It's hard. But when
        you labour over your thinking and when you take time to
        meet the challenge of thinking, then you will be rewarded
        for your efforts.
        <br />
        <br />
        The key challenge explores the skill of identifying the
        features of a concept. That is, the skill of identifying
        what a set of objects or thoughts have in common and what
        makes them different from each other. In this case, the
        kids must search through a pile of keys. What they all have
        in common is that they are keys – they open locks. But
        there are features that make the one they're looking for
        distinct from the others.
        <br />
        <br />
        The bridge challenge represents the fact that thinking
        conceptually and thinking things through thoroughly is not
        easy. And if you take the easy way out, i.e., not thinking
        things through, then you'll land up in trouble.
        <br />
        <br />
        The final challenge simply represents the difficulty of
        making the choice to always think things through versus the
        much easier option of simply stealing other people's
        thoughts.
        <br />
        <br />
        Escaping the cave with the apple requires that the kids
        draw on all the thinking lessons that they have learned.
        And failing to use their mental skills correctly puts the
        Thunderbolt kids in danger. The first “stolen” apple,
        represents an idea that hasn’t been taken apart and
        understood and it is finally replaced with an apple that
        has been earned. It has been earned because acquiring it
        required thinking. Earning the apple represents learning
        about ideas, step by step.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Activity</strong>
        <br />
        This activity challenges learners to explore the concept of
        school and to think about al the ideas that relate to it.
        <br />
        <br />
        The purpose is to practise using a graphic organiser to
        keep track of their thoughts so that they can see a visual
        representation of the interconnectedness of concepts.
        <br />
        <br />
        In doing this activity we want learners to recognise that
        thinking about ideas is much simpler than it sounds if you
        use tools to help you. Using graphic tools to keep track of
        and organise your thoughts helps make the work of thinking
        more effective.

        </div>The eToys project: Making an active
        essay<strong><br /></strong>In this project Sophie shows
        learnes how to create a book in eToys, and how to use a
        book to create an active essay. An active essay is an essay
        on a computer that contains not only text, but some form of
        computerized interaction. Unlike a printed essay, an active
        essay can have animations, buttons, calculators, and
        simulations built into the pages. Sophie shows learners how
        to put an animated fox and rabbit into a book to tell a
        simple story. The intention behind this project is to
        inspire learners to think of eToys as a tool or medium for
        exploring and communicating ideas. <strong><br /></strong>
