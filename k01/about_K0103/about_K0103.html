        <strong>Theme:</strong> Testing your inferences.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Synopsis</strong>
        <br />
        In “The Lunar Menace” the Thunderbolt Kids use a virtual
        reality machine to explore how people in different times
        and places have thought about the moon. They visit the
        Apollo moon landing. They visit Copernicus and Galileo. And
        they visit ancient China. When they reach medieval
        Transylvania and chance upon a mythical werewolf Farrah is
        frightened senseless. Over the next few days some of the
        other learners take delight in scaring Farrah, who can’t
        seem to shake off her fear of werewolves. Eventually she
        comes to the realisation that there is a difference between
        fact and fiction or science and superstition. And she
        resolves to treat scary situations more sceptically. Later,
        when a werewolf storms into her room she realises it’s a
        trick and introduces the two kids in the werewolf costumes
        to her baseball bat.
        <br />
        <br />
        The times and places visited in the virtual reality machine
        introduce two fundamentally different ways of thinking
        about the moon: the way of science; and the way of
        superstition. This mirrors two fundamentally different ways
        of thinking about anything we’re confronted with in our
        daily lives: thinking sceptically or thinking naively and
        magically. Thinking sceptically doesn’t mean disbelieving
        everything. It simply means testing the ideas we encounter
        rather than blindly accepting as true whatever information
        we’re exposed to.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Activity:</strong> The Moon Experiment
        <br />
        This Moon Experiment explains how to set up an activity in
        the classroom where learners can see for themselves how
        light coming from a single source (such as a powerful torch
        or lamp) lights up only one side of a ball. When they look
        at the ball they sometimes see the whole illuminated face,
        sometimes half of it, sometimes a quarter, and sometimes
        only the dark side. Just like the phases of the moon.
        <br />
        <br />
        This activity brings phases of the moon into the classroom
        in a memorable way. But the purpose of this exercise is not
        simply to provide a memorable activity. The purpose is to
        have learners test the claims in the science textbook by
        conducting an experiment for themselves. The ideas about
        the moon in a science textbook should never be introduced
        in the way that children once learned magical ideas about
        the moon. If we introduce scientific ideas to learners in
        the same way that people hundreds of years ago introduced
        magical ideas about the moon, then we really aren’t
        providing them with a role model of critical, analytical or
        scientific thinking. A textbook is not a holy book that
        must be accepted as the final word. A science textbook
        should not be treated as dogma to be learned faithfully by
        heart and never questioned. We want learners to question
        the claims made in their science textbooks. We want them to
        think of ways of confirming the claims in their textbooks
        though activities and experiments.

        </div><strong>The eToys project:</strong> The Lunar
        Menace<strong><br /></strong>In this project learners
        follow Tom’s instructions and build an animation showing
        the phases of the moon. This is the first time that
        learners are introduced to animation in eToys. In addition
        to Tom’s animation of the phases of the moon, the splash
        page includes animated bats and a castle with flickering
        lights. The moon on the splash page also moves. The
        intention behind this splash page is to show learners that
        the animation technique they learn in the project is the
        same animation technique used to create the bats. This is
        important because it carries the message that the serious
        content of a Kusasa lesson can be used for fun,
        self-expressive, entertaining purposes.
