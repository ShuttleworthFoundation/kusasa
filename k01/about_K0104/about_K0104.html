        <br />
        <strong>Theme:</strong> Changing your point of view.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Thunderbolt kids use the virtual reality machine to
        explore the imagination and artwork of MC Escher. When they
        enter the artwork, perspective is distorted as up and down
        and left and right often swap. The kids are enthralled but
        Lazlo keeps mocking Jojo and claiming that he is too much
        of a jock to appreciate the experience. When the kids
        return to class Tia sets them a challenge: they have to
        find the odd one out among three objects suspended in
        coloured tubes, high off the ground. Jojo stands on a chair
        to get a better look. Or rather a look from a different
        perspective.
        <br />
        <br />
        That night Jojo dreams he is trapped in one of Escher's
        drawings. To escape from some strange creatures he must
        suspend his own point of view and adopt Escher's strange
        perspective that if he swims straight along a river he will
        actually travel upwards. When he wakes up from the dream he
        realises that Tia's three objects only look different from
        each other depending on your point of view. When he
        explains this to the class he gets his own back on Lazlo,
        who previously went out of his way to mock his
        intelligence.
        <br />
        <br />
        This story brings the concept of perspective, or point of
        view, down to a physical level. Entering the world of
        Escher's art provides a rich landscape for exploring
        perspective because the artist cheated and played with
        perspective in his drawings to spectacular effect.
        <br />
        <br />
        Jojo’s dream is a metaphor for changing your point of view.
        That is why his dream is so strange and threatening:
        changes of perspective can be scary. But, as Tia says,
        “sometimes they can help us to think about things in new
        ways.” This metaphor will teach your learners that it’s
        okay to be scared of the unknown but also that knowledge is
        power and can cause unfamiliar perspectives to become
        familiar and therefore no longer scary.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Activity:</strong> The Shapes Activity
        <br />
        This activity challenges learners to construct a new
        personal perspective on shapes, i.e., a physical
        perspective. By challenging the learners to walk out shapes
        on the floor and then describe their experience in words,
        we want them to internalise a physical point of view for
        the form of each shape. This will help prepare them for the
        task of programming eToys to automatically draw each shape.

        </div><strong>The eToys project:</strong> Making
        shapes<strong><br /></strong>In this project learners
        follow Jojo’s instructions and discover how to leave pen
        trails and make shapes in eToys. Jojo starts out by getting
        learners to move a “Jojo bot” in a playfield, and to leave
        a pen trail. Then Jojo shows learners how to create a
        script to automate the creation of a triangle, a square, a
        pentagon, etc. Eventually learners construct a generalised
        “Draw” script which draws a closed figure given any number
        of sides. Learners can then experiment to see what happens
        as the number of sides becomes progressively larger and the
        polygons become more and more like a circle.
