        <strong>Synopsis</strong>
        <br />
        Tia shows The Thunderbolt kids a Rube Goldberg machine –an
        overcomplicated device that does something simple. In this
        case it launches a rocket. Tia shows the kids this device
        to teach them about cause and effect and the principle of
        thinking past stage one. That is, thinking about the
        medium- and long-term consequences of an action or a
        phenomenon, and not just the immediate consequences.
        (You'll notice that the machine is actually divided into
        different stages that are labeled from stages 1 to 3.)
        <br />
        <br />
        One of the machine’s many steps involves a rabbit. After
        the lesson our four protagonists are asked to return it to
        its hutch. When they return the rabbit Tom finds a glowing
        green mushroom in the store room. The kids read the
        instructions and learn that rabbits love to eat these
        mushrooms and that it causes their fur to change colour. In
        a flawed attempt to think past stage one, they take some
        spores and run off to plant them. Unfortunately they don’t
        finish reading the growing instructions and so they miss
        the warning to not water the mushrooms.
        <br />
        <br />
        Planting the spores is easy and the kids run inside to miss
        the rain. They don’t know that water causes the mushrooms
        to grow uncontrollably because they didn’t finish reading
        the instructions. This means they wake up to quite a shock
        later that night: the mushrooms are huge and have taken
        over the entire vegetable garden. Tia is furious and tells
        them to fix the problem by dawn. The kids read the rest of
        the instructions and learn that they can use rabbits to eat
        them right out of the ground. Unfortunately the exhausted
        Thunderbolt kids have forgotten how much damage bunnies can
        do and forget to put them back in their hutches. Now the
        sleep-deprived kids have to go track down the rabbit.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Mushroom Effect presents a cautionary tale about the
        failure to think ahead. It deals with practical mistakes
        that emphasise the need to imagine "what will happen next"
        and to use that thinking to avoid trouble. So while the
        Thunderbolt kids should have done things differently, it is
        their failure to think ahead that is important. That is, to
        use all the available information to think beyond stage
        one.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Activity</strong>: A domino rally
        <br />
        This activity challenges learners to use objects in the
        classroom to set up a domino rally. The ideas of a
        situation "mushrooming" out of control or having a run-on
        effect, as dominoes do, are both metaphors for the
        principle of thinking beyond stage one. So this activity
        extends the metaphorical look at cause and effect that we
        explore in the story.
        <br />
        <br />
        The purpose is to allow learners to physically work with
        objects in a way that demands that they think beyond stage
        one to achieve the best possible outcome. That is, to build
        the longest and most effective domino rally that it is
        possible for them to build, given what they have available.
        <br />
        <br />
        In doing this activity we want learners to question the
        relationship between objects and their properties. And we
        want them to recognise that different objects have
        properties that make them behave differently from each
        other. Recognising these properties and their implications
        can help them to make effective predictions about their
        behaviour, which will help them learn to manipulate objects
        effectively.

        </div><strong>The eToys project:</strong> Dominoes
        <br />
        In this project Tom shows learners how to build a chain of
        cause-and-effect in eToys. In this instance, learners
        create a domino rally where one domino knocks down another.
        This is an important step for learners. They are learning
        how objects can be given properties and how these
        properties govern the interaction of objects. Learners need
        to be comfortable with programming simple interactions
        before they are ready to understand how properties can be
        passed from one object to another.
