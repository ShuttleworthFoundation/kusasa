        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Theme:</strong> The importance of asking questions.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Synopsis</strong>
        <br />
        In this story Sophie discovers a strange bird. After asking
        a string of questions about its appearance she deduces
        that, however improbable, it may be a dodo. When she turns
        her skill for asking questions to the suspicious characters
        who claim that they bird is theirs, she uncovers a fiendish
        plot and saves the day for Dr Roberts and his birds from
        the bird sanctuary.
        <br />
        <br />
        Almost everything Sophie says in this story is a question.
        Her idol, Sherlock Holmes, was famous for making
        observations and using them to ask intelligent questions to
        solve his cases. This is the method Sophie uses to save the
        Dr Roberts' birds. It is also the method she uses
        throughout the story to find out information
        <br />
        <br />
        Sophie knows what questions to ask to find out what type of
        bird Flim-Flam is (Can it fly? How much does it weigh? What
        colour is it? How tall is it?). The answers could prove or
        disprove her dodo hypothesis. But she is not asking these
        questions to find support for her theory. Like Sherlock
        Holmes, Sophie uses observations and questions about those
        observations to find the truth.

        <br />
        <strong>Activity:</strong> The Ball Experiment
        <br />
        The Ball Experiment is derived from asking a simple
        question: How many times does a ball bounce? This is
        something so apparently familiar that we almost feel as
        though we should be able to answer the question
        immediately. However, a little experimenting reveals that
        different balls bounce differently on different surfaces
        and there is no standard answer.
        <br />
        <br />
        Although it is a relatively simple experiment, it does pose
        a couple of challenges. Firstly, bouncing and catching the
        ball at the right moment requires concentration and
        precision. And, secondly, accurately recording the height
        of each bounce requires focus. You have to take great care
        to get accurate results, which is true of all scientific
        endeavours, whether the experiment is as simple or whether
        it is complicated and delicate. Responding to these
        challenges is the main learning point of exercise.

        </div><strong>The eToys project:</strong> Bounce
        <br />
        In this project learners follow Jojo’s instructions to make
        a ball bounce in eToys to match the bounce of a ball in
        reality. This is perhaps the best Kusasa eToys modelling
        project because:
        <br />

        <ul class="disc">
          <li>It entails an object like a ball which is familiar
          and interesting to learners.</li>

          <li>The purpose is to make the onscreen ball behave like
          a real ball.</li>

          <li>Learners can see for themselves that their analytical
          efforts are rewarded.</li>

          <li>Once learners have modelled the bounce, Jojo shows
          learners how to get the ball to leave a pen trail, which
          of course creates a series of diminishing parabolas.</li>
        </ul>At this early stage the parabolas are not meant to be
        a focal learning point. They are merely an instructional
        “cherry on the top”. When learners come to learn about
        parabolas perhaps several years later, they will be able to
        relate what they learn then to the pen trails they created
        in this eToys project.
